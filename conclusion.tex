Mixed reality technologies are in the process of emerging into the mainstream. Although billions of dollars have been spent in development, they aren't yet entrenched in our lives. The technology is still malleable. By combining anticipatory foresight and reasoning with insights from similar entrenched technologies, like AI, this paper plausibly identifies and evaluates ethical issues in the field. MR occupies a complex space with significant overlaps and intersections with fields ranging from machine learning to healthcare and education; however, this paper identifies and discusses unique aspects of MR technology that set this area apart. This paper also recommends actions to take to mitigate negative impacts of the technology and enable not just ethical frameworks and guidance, but also ethical practice.
